The problem we are trying to solve here is very specific and generally related to an internal inability of React.
The problem is that whenever we need to send props from one component to another we have to send it during calling of a component,
this leads to dependency such that the prop is first sent by parent to child by calling the child component likewise child component
send props to its subchild and so on. 
Therefore if one of the component in between fails to render then the components down the multi-level heirarchy will not be called thus the 
creating dependency and ultimately the props will be not be send so respectively.


To solve this problem we use Context API.
Imagine a sack consisting of Apples is available publicly such that anyone in requiring the need for apple can pick it up from the sack, this is the
primary idea of Context API whereas in case of traditional props sending heirarchy, imagine the a queue of people waiting extending there hand to 
take the apple such that the apple will be delivered only the previous person standing in the gives you, thus you are dependent on the person`s standing before you
to give that apple to you.



In Context API, the parent component creates a context using 'createContext()' lets say 

'''
    myContext = createContext({/*your data*/});      //you may give default data and update it using useState to finally send it via .Provider

    <myContext.Provider >
        <OneComponent/>
        <TwoComponent/>
    <myContext.Provider/>

'''


in OneComponent, in order use the content of myContext use useContext()
'''
    import {myContext} from 'Path/Parent';

    ...
    ...
    const {/*destructure elements*/} = useContext(myContext);

'''
